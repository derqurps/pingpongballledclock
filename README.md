# Ping Pong Ball LED Clock

This is my code repository for the Project Ping Pong Ball LED Clock by thomasj152 as seen here https://www.instructables.com/Ping-Pong-Ball-LED-Clock/

This is for use with an ESP32 and without RTC. Clock synchronization is done by NTP.

This Project uses a arduino_sectrets.h file. See the demo file for an example
